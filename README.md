- Query EDA Project - Business Recommendations
  - Objective: Complete EDA by querying bike sharing data and write up business recommendation on new offers to create from analyzed bike trips. 
- ML Topic Classification
  - Objective: Classify newsgroup posts on a variety of topics into 1 of 4 different categories -trained and optimized three models using K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive-Bayes, and Logistic Regression algorithms. 
- ML Digit Classification
  - Objective: Use different image recognition techniques to find the optimum way to predict digits, used both K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes algorithms.
